    <h2>About the Founder</h2>
    <p>I first had the idea when I witnessed a boy bullying another smaller boy. The next day, I found the small boy and talked to him about his feelings. We ended up sharing many interests and we became fast friends.</p>
    <p> As we were walking home from school, the bully pushed my friend into mud. I devised a plan to get back at the bully. As you can guess, the first DirtParcel Delivery was made. After this incident, Jake(the small boy) founded DirtParcel and were devoted to helping people all around the world to sent dirt to others who either are dirtbags or are just the victims of a prank.</p>
